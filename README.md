# Pop-Up Ad created for EuropeBet

This is a small pop-up ad about the upcoming events held in Malta.

1) This application is a pop-up ad. 
2) Based on clicked dates, content changes and shows events held on that particular date. 
3) It was created with a mobile-first approach. 
4) For this project I used Vite+React because I believe it was the most suitable for completing this task.
5) As this project is just a pop-up ad, it's not stretched to the full width of the screen unless it's a mobile/tablet device. 
6) The most challenging part for me was to create an additional ad slider at the end of every page with a drag function and without any libraries.
